# Platinum

> An always-experimental frontend for [PatchyVideo/PatchyVideo](https://github.com/PatchyVideo/PatchyVideo).
> (Currently using [PatchyVideo/pvgql](https://github.com/PatchyVideo/pvgql) as backend.)

This is a **complete** rewrite of [PatchyVideo/patchyvideo-vue](https://github.com/PatchyVideo/patchyvideo-vue).

## Alpha Roadmap

It's hard to tell based on what we did so far. All the things we did are basically Proof of Concepts.
But we expect to ship following features on top of the current website:

- [ ] A brand new interface with full responsive design.
- [ ] Full dark mode support.
- [ ] Full custom-able home screen / user profile.
- [ ] A new home made video player.

## Getting Started

```bash
gh repo clone PatchyVideo/platinum
cd platinum
yarn
yarn codegen # generate code schema
yarn dev # launch vite dev server
yarn build # pack the website
```

## Technologies

The full dependencies list can be found in the generated NOTICE.txt file.

We want to say thanks to all the contributors that built the softwares/components/packages we used in this project. Without you, we'll have a lot more hard time.
